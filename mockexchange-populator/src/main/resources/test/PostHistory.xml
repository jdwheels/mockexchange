This belief typically comes from the fact that comments can become stale (out of date) and can be difficult to maintain. However, having good comments which explain why the code is doing something a certain way can (and usually is) important for maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Good comments make it easier to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; understand what the code is doing and,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; more important, why it is doing it a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; particular way. Comments are meant to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be read by programmers and should be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clear and precise. A comment that is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hard to understand or incorrect isn’t&#xD;&#xA;&gt; much better than having had no comment&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at all.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Adding clear and precise comments to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your code means that you don’t have to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rely on memory to understand the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “what” and “why” of a section of code.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is most important when you look&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at that code later on, or someone else&#xD;&#xA;&gt; must look at your code. Because&#xD;&#xA;&gt; comments become part of the textual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; content of your code, they should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; follow good writing principles in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; addition to being clearly written.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; To&#xD;&#xA;&gt; write a good comment, you should do&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your best to document the purpose of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the code (the why, not how) and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indicate the reasoning and logic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; behind the code as clearly as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; possible. Ideally, comments should be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; written at the same time as you write&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the code.

It's a SOMETIMES NECESSARY THING, and Thomas Owens in the top answer provides an excellent explanation of the situations in which it's necessary. However, these situations rarely crop up in homework-type assignments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In many ways, adding a comment should be considered a last-resort choice, when what needs to be said cannot be said clearly in the active parts of the programming language. Although object naming can go stale, various human and computer lack-of-feedback mechanisms make it easy to forget to maintain comments and consequently comments go stale much more quickly than active code. For that reason, where a choice is possible, changing code to make it clearer should always be preferred to annotating unclear code with comments. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 2.5" />

A perfectly good idiom may be considered a CodeSmell because it's often misused, or because there's a simpler alternative that works in most cases. Calling something a CodeSmell is not an attack; it's simply a sign that a closer look is warranted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what does it mean that comments are a code-smell: it means that when you see a comment, you should pause and think: &quot;Hmmm, I sense a hint that something could be improved&quot;. Perhaps you can rename a variable, perform the &quot;extract method&quot;-refactoring -- or perhaps the comment is actually the best solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**That is what it means for comments to be code smells.**&#xD;&#xA;--&#xD;&#xA;EDIT:&#xD;&#xA;I just stumpled upon these two articles, which explains it better than me:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Apologies In code][2] &#xD;&#xA;* [To Need Comments][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ToNeedComments" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'm a senior developer and I tend to write comments aimed at explaining what is otherwise simple for me to understand. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see it as a form of posthumous team communication or education. I encourage the team to look through code they are using, but maybe haven't written to understand it better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A couple of examples just from this week (PHP code):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    //Pattern for finding jpeg photos&#xD;&#xA;    //Case insensitive pattern for jpg and jpeg&#xD;&#xA;    const PATTERN_PHOTO = &quot;*.{[jJ][pP][gG],[jJ][pP][eE][gG]}&quot;;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd hope the name `PATTERN_PHOTO` would be helpful later in code to explain what it does, but without the comments how clear would it be to a junior developer what this specific pattern does?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Same set of code:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    //Ignore . and .. directories in Linux&#xD;&#xA;    if($file != &quot;.&quot; &amp;&amp; $file != &quot;..&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's an expectation that our developers know PHP, but not that they understand the Linux OS we are using for hosting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I find these comments to actually increase the overall efficiency of our team for the very little time it takes to write them.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - There's less cases of people rewriting code simply because they don't understand how it works. &quot;I didn't understand how it did what it was supposed to, so I fixed it.&quot; Seriously, I've had to deal with this before.&#xD;&#xA; - There are less questions asked about individual pieces of code.  Answering the questions just once, usually requires looking up the code and the time for me to re-familiarize myself with it. And sometimes I'll get the same question from more than one person weeks apart. (*Yes, it would be on things as simple as the examples above*)&#xD;&#xA; - Other developers are encouraged and guided to learn on their own.  I'd expect that if they came across `//Ignore . and .. directories in Linux` they'd likely hop on Google and would suddenly understand Linux a little bit better.&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Throughout the process, you will try and fail, and try and fail. **We all do this.** The true answer is there are two types of programmers, those that comment and those that don't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) Those that do are either making their own job easier by documenting for future reference, commenting out failed routines that didn't work (the smell is not deleting them after finding the one that works.), or breaking up the code with comment formatting to *hopefully* make it a bit easier to read or understand. Seriously, I can't blame them. But in the end, they snap and then you have this:&#xD;&#xA;`// dammit this code sucks! swear! curse! i hate it! i am going to write something here to vent my anger!!!!`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Those that don't are either pretending to be a superhero, or [are living in a cave][2].
